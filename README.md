Cybercrime project: build a intrusion detection ML-based modeule using KDD Cup 1999 Data.

The datasets can be retrived at https://www.kdd.org/kdd-cup/view/kdd-cup-1999/Data, since the file are too big for Github.

The datasets used:

- kddcup.names: A list of features
- kddcup.data_10_percent_corrected: Train Data
- corrected.zip: Test data with corrected labels.
- training_attack_types: A list of intrusion types.
